## Contribution Guidelines
> **Note**: Start working only after you have been assigned the task. Pull requests made to unassigned tasks will be rejected.
- If you create a new issue, **wait for the maintainers to assign** it to you as well.
- If directory for your question is not present, create one with the format `Find_Middle_of_Linked_List`.
  - Note the underscores and title case of the words
- Add your script file inside the question directory and name it as `Firstname_Lastname.extension`
  - Extension can be any language like .c, .cpp, .py, etc.
  - Make sure the filename is in title case
  - Add a comment section at the **top** including an explanation for your algorithm
  - Also add the time and space complexities at the top
- Do not create a script with only a Solution class. Add `boilerplate code` so maintainers can run the code locally.
- **Do not** overwrite contributions done by other people.
